## [_Cutthroat Caverns_](https://github.com/julianflood1/Cutthroat-Caverns)
  Cutthroat Caverns is a turn-based card game that I helped recreate for my group project in my JavaScript course. Myself, one other member from design, and two members from the C# cohort came together to make an electronic version of this game. You take turns to kill various creatures and need to work together to survive!

## [_Animal Tracker_](https://github.com/julianflood1/animal-tracker)
  This project is an AngularJS oriented site which allows users to add various animals to their zoo, add different features about the animals, and be able to edit, sort, and delete the animals when they want to.
