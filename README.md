## [_Cutthroat Caverns_](https://github.com/julianflood1/Cutthroat-Caverns)
  Cutthroat Caverns is a turn-based card game that I helped recreate for my group project in my JavaScript course. Myself, one other member from design, and two members from the C# cohort came together to make an electronic version of this game. You take turns to kill various creatures and need to work together to survive!
